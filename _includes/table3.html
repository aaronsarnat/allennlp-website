<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>Welcome to AllenNLP! This tutorial will walk you through the basics of building and training an AllenNLP model.</p>

<p>Before we get started, make sure you have a clean Python 3.6 or 3.7 virtual environment, and then run the following to install the AllenNLP library:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
pip install allennlp
{% endhighlight %}

<hr />

<p>In this tutorial we'll implement a slightly enhanced version of the PyTorch
<a href = "https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/sequence_models_tutorial.html#example-an-lstm-for-part-of-speech-tagging">LSTM for Part-of-Speech Tagging</a> tutorial,
adding some features that make it a slightly more realistic task (and that also showcase some of the benefits of AllenNLP):</p>

<ol class="formatted">
  <li>We'll read our data from files. (The tutorial example uses data that's given as part of the Python code.)</li>
  <li>We'll use a separate validation dataset to check our performance. (The tutorial example trains and evaluates on the same dataset.)</li>
  <li>We'll use <a href="https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm" target="_blank">tqdm</a> to track the progress of our training.</li>
  <li>We'll implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_stopping" target="_blank">early stopping</a> based on the loss on the validation dataset.</li>
  <li>We'll track accuracy on both the training and validation sets as we train the model.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>Given a sentence (e.g. <code>"The dog ate the apple"</code>) we want to predict part-of-speech tags for each word (e.g <code>["DET", "NN", "V", "DET", "NN"]</code>).</p>

<p>As in the PyTorch tutorial, we'll embed each word in a low-dimensional space, pass them through an LSTM to get a sequence of encodings, and use a feedforward layer to transform those into a sequence of logits (corresponding to the possible part-of-speech tags).</p>

<p>Below is the annotated code for accomplishing this.</p>

            In AllenNLP we represent each training example as an <code>Instance</code> containing <code>Field</code>s of various types.

            Typically to solve a problem like this using AllenNLP, you'll have to implement two classes. The first is a <a href ="https://allenai.github.io/allennlp-docs/api/allennlp.data.dataset_readers.html">DatasetReader</a>, which contains the logic for reading a file of data and producing a stream of <code>Instance</code>s.

            There are various ways to represent a word as one or more indices. For example, you might maintain a vocabulary of unique words and give each word a corresponding id. Or you might have one id per character in the word and represent each word as a sequence of ids. AllenNLP uses a <code>TokenIndexer</code> abstraction to represent this choice.

            The other class you'll basically always have to implement is <code>Model</code>, which is a subclass of <code>torch.nn.Module</code>. How it works is largely up to you, it mostly just needs a <code>forward</code> method that takes tensor inputs and produces a dict of tensor outputs that includes the loss you'll use to train the model.

            One thing that might seem unusual is that we're going to inject the embedder and the sequence encoder into the model. This allows us to experiment with different embedders and encoders without having to change the model code.

            The embedding layer is specified as an AllenNLP <code>TextFieldEmbedder</code> which represents a general way of turning tokens into tensors.

            Next we need to implement <code>forward</code>, which is where the actual computation happens. Each Instance in your dataset will get (batched with other instances and) fed into forward. The forward method expects tensors as input, and it expects their names to be the names of the fields in your Instance. In this case we have a sentence field and (possibly) a labels field, so we'll construct our `forward` accordingly:

            AllenNLP is designed to operate on batched inputs, but different input sequences have different lengths. Behind the scenes AllenNLP is padding the shorter inputs so that the batch has uniform shape, which means our computations need to use a mask to exclude the padding. Here we just use the utility function <code>get_text_field_mask</code>, which returns a tensor of 0s and 1s corresponding to the padded and unpadded locations.

            We included an accuracy metric that gets updated each forward pass. That means we need to override a <code>get_metrics</code> method that pulls the data out of it. Behind the scenes, the <code>CategoricalAccuracy</code> metric is storing the number of predictions and the number of correct predictions, updating those counts during each call to forward. Each call to get_metric returns the calculated accuracy and (optionally) resets the counts, which is what allows us to track accuracy anew for each epoch.

            When we launch it it will print a progress bar for each epoch that includes both the "loss" and the "accuracy" metric. If our model is good, the loss should go down and the accuracy up as we train.

            As in the original PyTorch tutorial, we'd like to look at the predictions our model generates. AllenNLP contains a <code>Predictor</code> abstraction that takes inputs, converts them to instances, feeds them through your model, and returns JSON-serializable results. Often you'd need to implement your own Predictor, but AllenNLP already has a <code>SentenceTaggerPredictor</code> that works perfectly here, so we can use it. It requires our model (for making predictions) and a dataset reader (for creating instances).

            It has a <code>predict</code> method that just needs a sentence and returns (a JSON-serializable version of) the output dict from forward.  Here "tag_scores" will be a (5, 3) array of logits, corresponding to the 3 possible tag for each of the 5 words.
